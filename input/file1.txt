In the realm of software development, there are countless languages, tools, and frameworks to choose from. 
Each one brings its own strengths, weaknesses, and quirks to the table. 
Among these tools, multithreading stands out as both powerful and challenging. 
It allows programs to perform many tasks simultaneously, unlocking greater speed and responsiveness. 
However, with great power comes great responsibility — and debugging multithreaded code can be a nightmare.

Imagine a tool that reads through hundreds of text files, analyzing their content for meaningful insights. 
This tool does not run sequentially, no — it harnesses the power of threads. 
Each file is assigned to a separate thread, analyzed in isolation, and the results are collected in a thread-safe map. 
The lines are counted. The characters are tallied. The file names are stored. 
The tool marches on, tirelessly, consuming one file after another.

And then, when the dust has settled, all those analyzed files are zipped together — neatly packed into a single archive. 
It’s not just analysis. It’s compression. It’s automation. It’s efficient. 
What began as a student project turned into a genuinely useful utility.

The developer, İrem, began the journey unsure of how threads worked. 
But soon she mastered `ConcurrentHashMap`, thread coordination, and file I/O. 
She wrote `FileAnalyzer`, a class that extended `Thread`, took a `File`, and returned its stats. 
She wrote `FileStats`, a clean data holder. And finally, a `Main` class to orchestrate it all.

Some files were small, some were long. Some had quotes from books, others were just test data. 
It didn’t matter. Each was read, processed, logged, and archived.

Over time, she added more features: total character count, total lines, sorted outputs, user interface.
Maybe one day, it would analyze PDFs, JSONs, maybe even do sentiment analysis.

But for now, it was just a beautiful example of how Java multithreading can be tamed.
